Making some coconuts for emily:

main nav has 4 headings:

* Season 1
  - multiple stage pages as children
    - each stage page has multiple weeks & one title match
      - week page renders teams head to head results


* Standings
  - one results table

* Teams
  - multi team pages

* Divisions
  - Atlantic / Pacific, links to team pages.

---

  ## TODO: //
  * make theme
  * redo styles formatting.
      - All to one page [x] DONE
      - split that one into few files based on what page/component they style

---
  get it basic first then add in functionality. searches that sort of stuff

  Standings is just a single thing so maybe it doesnt need it.
  Seasons is kinda big... idk

  The way im displaying the team-tiles is not ideal tbh

  Maybe for singleTeam view I save data on how large each photo / logo is.
