Making some coconuts for emily:

main nav has 4 headings:

* Season 1
  - multiple stage pages as children
    - each stage page has multiple weeks & one title match
      - week page renders teams head to head results


* Standings
  - one results table

* Teams
  - multi team pages

* Divisions
  - Atlantic / Pacific, links to team pages.

  get it basic first then add in functionality. searches that sort of stuff

  Maybe what I do is make a folder for each 4 main topics, then have components, pages within those? I do like Minded's organization structure.

  Standings is just a single thing so maybe it doesnt need it.
  Seasons is kinda big... idk
